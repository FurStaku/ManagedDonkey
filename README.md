## What is this?
This is Donkey, a project I started back in August 2022 after years of reverse engineering the Halo engine and learning C++ while I went.
I wanted to write my own take on what a Halo mod should be and started going to town, putting all the information I had in my head into one place that others could use it (*Except for Faber*).

## Getting started-ish
You can find files and info needed to use Donkey on the [File Share](https://github.com/twist84/DonkeyFileShare) repo.

## How can I help?
Mostly just by testing the Donkey out. Ideas are welcome. I don't want outside contributions, though, since this is my own project.
